 Python Design Patterns
========================

Welcome!

I’m **Brandon Rhodes**
(`website <https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/>`_,
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes>`_)
and this is my evolving guide to design patterns in the
`Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`_.

* This site is letting me collect my ideas about Python
  and Design Patterns all in one place.

* My hope is that these pages make the patterns more discoverable —
  easier to find in web searches, and easier to read —
  than when they were scattered across the videos and slides
  of my `Python conference talks <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/>`_.

* The weight of other obligations makes my progress intermittent.
  To check for new material,
  simply visit the commit history of this site’s
  `project repository on GitHub <https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-patterns>`_,
  where you can also select “Watch” to get updates.

With those preliminaries complete, here are the patterns!
